# html-css-js-FurnitureWebsite
This project is about Furniture Website. There are different products in our website with nice color theme.
I created a responsive and eye-catching landing page for a furniture e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. This project shows my skills in front-end development and user-friendly design.
The page starts with a clean header that includes a logo, a search bar, and a menu with links to different furniture categories like Living Room, Bedroom, Dining Table, and Home Office. This makes it easy for users to find what they're looking for.
The hero section features an automatic image slider with a promotional message and a "Shop Now" button that leads users to the product section. I used a CSS Grid layout to neatly display different furniture items like beds, sofas, dining tables, and office chairs in card-style boxes. Each card has an image, a short description, and a price.
I added hover effects and icons (like Location, Favorites, and Cart) to make the page more interactive and engaging.
Throughout the design, I focused on making the website easy to use on all devices. I kept the color scheme and fonts consistent to give it a clean and professional look.
